For a man who was forced into a fairly abrupt U-turn, Alexis Tsipras remains extraordinarily popular.

If he calls an early election in the coming months - and that still feels like the most likely option - it would be a huge surprise if he didn't win comfortably and emerge stronger.

That's partly because the opposition is in disarray. But also because many Greeks like the fact that he appeared to stand up for national pride.

For the moment Mr Tsipras is trying to put pressure on dissenters within his own party. He had heard plenty of heroic speeches, the prime minister said, but not seen any alternative proposals.

It's partly a reminder that he could move to exclude those who are disloyal if another election is just around the corner.

But he has to get the bailout approved first - and that's not yet a done deal.

Battle over eurozone's future

Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said it was "extremely important" for the vote on financial and judicial reforms to pass so that talks on the bailout could begin on Friday.

Last week's vote was on the austerity measures imposed by Greece's creditors - a mix of economic reforms and budget cuts demanded by the eurozone countries and institutions before bailout talks could continue.

The measures due to be presented to parliament on Wednesday are of a more structural nature, including:

    a code of civil protection aimed at speeding up court cases
    the adoption of an EU directive to bolster banks and protect savers' deposits of less than 100,000
    the introduction of rules that would see bank shareholders and creditors - not taxpayers - cover costs of a failed bank

More contentious measures - phasing out early retirement and tax rises for farmers - have been pushed back to August.
